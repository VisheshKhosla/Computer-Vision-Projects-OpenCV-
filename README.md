# Computer-Vision-Projects-OpenCV-
I have created these computer vision projects using OpenCV.

Morphological Transformations: Applied erosion,dilation,opening,closing,morphological gradient and tophat on an image.

Object Detection and Object Tracking:
->Converted the image from BGR format to HSV format. 
->Created a Trackbar to adjust HSV values. 
->Applied a mask on the image to highlight a particular color(using bitwise AND).

Smoothing and Blurring Images:Applied 2DFilter,Blur,Gaussian_Blur,Median_Blur,Bilateral Filter on images.
                               Gaussian Blur:The center pixels have more weight.
                               Median Blur: For removing salt and pepper noice that is the white and the black dots on an image.
